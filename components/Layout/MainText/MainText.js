The patient was upright on the chest x-ray and there is no evidence for free air on the upright film. This finding may then be best explained by the administration of contrast or coating of the bowel wall by an ingested substance. Findings should be correlated clinically. If there are abdominal symptoms a followup abdomen film could be considered. Findings conveyed to the referring clinicianâ€™s office at time of interpretation. </span>
